## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects. Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## About This Project

This website was developed during a 3-month face-to-face extension course held at the University of Passo Fundo (UPF), with the companies Umentor and Elevor as partners. The project was intended to be the conclusion of the classes, developed completely in Laravel to run on local machines. My project consists of organizing the vehicle fleet of a fictitious company called Monte Vecchio. Using the system, we can see the presence of an access system (login, registration and password recovery) and the simple control of adding, editing and deleting records (vehicles).
